                    Giovan Battista Basile was born on 3rd February 1583 in a middle-class family from Naples. 
                    The exact location of his birth has been object of constant debate since scholars started to seriously
                    focus on this peculiar figure in neapolitan history.
                    According to some studies, his birthplace is to be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giugliano_in_Campania">Giugliano in Campania</a>, a town in the modern day province of Naples. 
                    This hypothesis was first proposed by Andrea Tagliatela, who discovered a baptismal certificate in the city with the name of
                    of the author and the year 1566 as his birth year; this thesis was then reproposed later by Emanuele Coppola in his 1998 essay
                    <a href="https://opac.sbn.it/risultati-ricerca-avanzata/-/opac-adv/detail/NAP0313239?"><em>Giovan Battista Basile nacque a Giugliano nel 1566</em></a>,
                    and it quickly became common knowledge.
                    In 2023 though, a small revolution in the studies on Basile took place: Domenico Antonio D'Alessandro, in his essay <a href="https://www.academia.edu/104275835/Giovan_Battista_Basile_tra_favole_campanilistiche_e_realt%C3%A0_documentaria"><em>Giovan Battista Basile tra "favole" campanilistiche e realtà documentaria</em></a>
                    revealed that the writer was born in 1583 from Francesco Antonio Basile and Cornelia Daniele, as the certifacte of the baptism describes:
                    <div class="quotation">
                        <p>A dì 4 de febraro 1583, io detto don Lorenzo de Feo ho baptizato Giovan Baptista Biasi, ﬁglio [de] lo signor Francesco Antonio Basile 
                            et de la signora Cornelia Daniele ad Monte Calvario, la comare la signora Agata Cicala, la mammana Rosa De Santo, per clerico Vicenso Francese.</p>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theory seems to be confirmed by two details that come out from the sources and the biography of Basile:
                </p>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>His sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriana_Basile">Adriana Basile</a>'s baptism certificate was redacted in the same church three years later; it's possible that the family
                        lived in the area.
                    </li>
                    <li>In his seminal work <em>Lo cunto de Li Cunti</em>, Basile never makes any references to Giugliano. This is a peculiar thing for an author that consistently
                        uses references to locations where he actually lived and spent time.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As it was required for a person of his social class, Basile grew up in the complex system of parrish education in Naples. It's here that he met and became
                    life friend with another incredible neapolitan author, Giulio Cesare Cortese, the author of the "Vaiasseide". Their friendship seemingly lasted for the entirety
                    of their lives, and a testimony of this is the reccurent amount of references between the two in their literary works. Cortese directly makes a reference to his friend
                    in his work <em>The Travel to Parnaso</em>:
                    <div class="quotation">
                        <p>Che la fortuna ammico me facette / Da che ghieva a la scola peccerillo</p>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important testimony of their relationship is the big correspondence they held all throught their incredibly messy and complex lives, constantly quoted and 
                    references by both in their works.
