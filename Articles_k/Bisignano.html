            <h1>Bisignano</h1>
            <p>Bisignano (Calabrian: Visignànu) is a town and comune in the province of Cosenza, part of the Calabria region of southern Italy. It is situated on hills in the Crati valley, between the Pollino and Sila National Parks. The town has historically been settled and inhabited by an Arbëreshë community. In 1467, the daughter of the Albanian leader Skanderbeg, who was the wife of the Prince of Bisignano, invited many Albanian families to this region, and they established various colonies, where they spoke their own language and used the Greek Rite. Skanderbeg had previously helped King Ferdinand I of Naples to end a French-supported insurrection and had been rewarded with the grant of land in Apulia. An alternative version maintains that it was Skanderbeg's niece Irene Castriota, Duchess of San Pietro di Galatina and wife of Pietro Antonio Sanseverino, Prince of Bisignano, who invited Albanians to settle in the area. This was one of the origins of Calabria's Italo-Albanian Arbëreshë community.
                Luca Antonio Pirozzo, better known as St. Humilis of Bisignano (1582–1637), was a Franciscan friar born in Bisignano.</p>

                Bisignano is cited by Basile as a famous place for the breeding of horses. The horse breeds of the Sanseverino family
                of Bisignano were prized and celebrated throughout Europe.
