            <h1>Pietrasecca</h1>
            <p>
                A fortified center of the Equi was most likely located at the site, while the Roman presence is evidenced by ceramic fragments and a funerary inscription.
               According to local tradition, the foundation of the present settlement is due to King Pippin, who not far from the contemporary settlement founded the castle of Luppa,[5] where he died in 810 to be buried at Fosso Feca. Pietrasecca was conquered, along with Saracinesco, by Saracens retreating on the Via Valeria and later recaptured by papal troops. The remains of fortress works erected over the centuries using both Western and Eastern techniques can still be appreciated. The structure of the inner citadel presents a mighty wall of which, after the earthquakes that occurred over the centuries, traces are preserved and are clearly visible. The imposing original fortress can be observed especially from the northwest side, near today's cemetery.
               Indeed, from this angle most of the surviving fortress works can be observed. The locality was fortified from the earliest times, even before the dominance of Equus, because of its strategic position. A position it preserved in Roman times on the route of the Valeria consular road and strengthened in medieval times to be on the border between the Lombard duchies of Spoleto and Benevento.

            <h2 class="sottotitolo">The Beauty without Hands (Third Day, Cecca)</h2>
            <p>
                The king of Piterasecca wants to marry his sister Penta, and he says he loves her hands most of all. Penta then has a slave cut them off and sends them to her brother on a tray. The king is resentful and has Penta thrown into the sea in a box. Penta is found by fishermen and Masiello leaves her in the care of his wife Nuccia, but she is jealous of Penta and throws her back into the sea. Penta is found by the ship of the king of Terraverde, who puts her as a lady-in-waiting to his wife; Penta makes everyone love her and learns to do everything with her feet. Some time later the queen is on the verge of death and makes her husband promise to marry Penta, about whom little is known but who has shown herself to be of noble birth and a good person. The king remarries Penta, who becomes pregnant.
