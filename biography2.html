                <p> After a couple of years (1599-1601) of apprenticeship with his grandfather, the notary Salvatore Daniele, at the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consiglio_collaterale">Corte Collaterale</a> (one
                    of the most important neapolitan institutions of the period), he moved to Cosenza (in Calabria). It is not really known in which capacity he
                    moved to Calabria (probably to work), but it's in this period that he publishes the first documentary work, a series of letters sent to his friend
                    Cortese as a preface for his work <em>Vaiasseide</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is back in Naples in September of the same year for the wedding of his sister, and shortly after he departs the Kingdom of Naples for the Republic
                    of Venice, where he starts to work as a mercenary, mioving frequently between Venice itself and Candia (modern day Krete), where he starts to work with
                    the intellectuals of the Accademia degli Stravaganti, active of on the venetian colony in the Aegean. In 1605 his viallanella <em>Smorza Crudel Amore</em> is 
                    published in Naples by Giovan Domenico Montella, the liutist and organist of the Royal Chapel of Naples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1608 he is back again in Naples, where he publishes the poemetto <em>Il pianto della Vergine</em>, while in 1610 he is at the sevice of the Louis II of Carafa, fourth
                    prince of Stigliano as a court intellectual, where he publishes maritime fable (<em>Le Avventure Disavventure</em>) with his brother Donato Basile, a musician who worked with him for the prince.
                    Thanks to the protection of the prince, Basile manages to be accepted at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_degli_Oziosi">Accademia degli Oziosi</a>, a neapolitan institution founded in 1611 that gathered all the 
                    most important neapolitan intellectuals, a scholarly group who had clear republican ideals and played an important role during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_Republic_(1647%E2%80%931648)">Revolution of 1647-48</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of 1612 he leaves Naples again to stay with his sister Adriana in Mantua. His sister had become one of the most famous singers in Europe, and he began to
                    help her family members to get commissions and jobs around Italy. During the year when he lived in Mantua, Basile publishes a plethora of works dedicated to his sister,
                    poems, eclogues, fables and odes, like "
                    <em>Egloghe amorose e lugubri</em>, the second edition for <em>Il pianto della Vergine</em> and the pastoral fable <em>La Venere Addolorata</em>. In 
                    the same period, he is granted the title of "cavalier" by the duke of Mantua Ferdinando Gonzaga
