            <h1>Scotland</h1>
            <p>
                Scotland (Scots: Scotland; Scottish Gaelic: Alba) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It contains nearly one-third of the United Kingdom's land area, consisting of the northern part of the island of Great Britain and more than 790 adjacent islands, principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. 
                To the south-east, Scotland has its only land border, which is 96 miles (154 km) long and shared with England; the country is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the north-east and east, and the Irish Sea to the south. The population in 2022 was 5,439,842 and accounts for 8% of the population of the UK.
                Edinburgh is the capital and Glasgow is the largest of the cities of Scotland.

            <h2 class="sottotitolo">Corvetto (Third Day, Antonella)</h2>
            <p>
                Scotland is cited here as the dwelling of an ogre, who was exiled by the king of Scotland. Corvetto, an intelligent but envied person, is sent to steal a horse from this ogre by the king, advised by his courtisans who despise and envy the main character for his intelligence and virtues.
