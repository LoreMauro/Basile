            <h1>Tyre</h1>
            <p>
                Tyre (/Ààta…™…ôr/; Arabic: ÿµŸèŸàÿ±, romanized: ·π¢≈´r; Phoenician: ê§ëê§ì, romanized: ·π¢≈´r; Greek: Œ§œçœÅŒøœÇ, translit. T√Ωros) is a city in Lebanon, one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, though in medieval times for some centuries by just a small population. It was one of the earliest Phoenician metropolises and the 
                legendary birthplace of Europa, her brothers Cadmus and Phoenix, as well as Carthage's founder Dido (Elissa). The city has many ancient sites, including the Tyre Hippodrome, and was added as a whole to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984. The historian Ernest Renan noted that "One can call Tyre a city of ruins, built out of ruins".
                Today Tyre is the fourth largest city in Lebanon after Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon.[5] It is the capital of the Tyre District in the South Governorate. There were approximately 200,000 inhabitants in the Tyre urban area in 2016, including many refugees, as the city hosts three of the twelve Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon: Burj El Shimali, 
                El Buss, and Rashidieh.

                Tyre is cited in this fable alongside other places famous for some products, in an effort to praise a beloved woma. Maremma was famos for its production of purple dye, which here are compared to the cheeks and rosey complection of the woman.
