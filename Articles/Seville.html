            <h1>Seville</h1>
            <p>
                Seville (/səˈvɪl/ sə-VIL; Spanish: Sevilla, pronounced [seˈβiʎa] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of Seville. It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir, in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula.
                Seville has a municipal population of about 701,000 as of 2022, and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, making it the largest city in Andalusia, the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 26th most populous municipality in the European Union. Its old town, with an area of 4 square kilometres (2 sq mi), 
                contains a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising three buildings: the Alcázar palace complex, the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies. The Seville harbour, located about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean, is the only river port in Spain. The capital of Andalusia features hot temperatures 
                in the summer, with daily maximums routinely above 35 °C (95 °F) in July and August.
                Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis. Known as Ishbiliyah after the Islamic conquest in 711, Seville became the centre of the independent Taifa of Seville following the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th century; later it was ruled by Almoravids and Almohads until being 
                incorporated to the Crown of Castile in 1248. Owing to its role as gateway of the Spanish Empire's trans-atlantic trade, managed from the Casa de Contratación, Seville became one of the largest cities in Western Europe in the 16th century. Coinciding with the Baroque period, the 17th century in Seville represented 
                the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture. Upon diminishing draught conditions in the Guadalquivir, the American trade gradually moved away from the city of Seville, initially in favor of downstream dependent berths and eventually in favor of the Bay of Cádiz, where the head of the fleets of the Indies (1680) and the Casa de la Contratación (1717) 
                were eventually transferred to.

                Seville is cited here as part of a saying, the "graces of Seville", meaning everything beautiful and of incredibly high quality. Seville was reknowned for the quality of its industries and the beauty of its women during Bsile's time.            </p>
