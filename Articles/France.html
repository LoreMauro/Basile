            <p>
                Tittone, son of the King of Verdecolle, sets out in search of his three step-sisters married to a falcon, a stag, and a dolphin, and after long journeys, he finds them. In hi search he visits many places, among them Frnace, obviously
                a place Italians from the period knew very well.

            <h2 class="sottotitolo">The Three Ceders (Fifth Day, Ciommetella)</h2>
            <p>
                Ciommetiello, son of the King of Torrelunga, has no intention to marry. One day he cuts his finger, and the red blood falls on some ricotta cheese; he becomes immediately enamored with the color combination, and he starts to
                desire a wife with the same color combination. So he starts to search the world for a wife, and one of the places he visits is France, where he jumps on a ship that will bring him to far off places in the world.
