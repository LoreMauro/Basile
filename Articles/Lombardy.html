            <h1>Lombardy</h1>
            <p>Lombardy (Italian: Lombardia;[c] Lombard: Lombardia) is an administrative region of Italy that covers 23,844 km2 (9,206 sq mi); it is located in northern Italy and has a population of about 10 million people, constituting more than one-sixth of Italy's population. 
                Lombardy is located between the Alps mountain range and tributaries of the river Po, and includes Milan, its capital, the largest metropolitan area in the country, and among the largest in the EU.
                Its territory is divided into 1,502 comuni (region with the largest number of comuni in the entire national territory), distributed in twelve administrative subdivisions (eleven provinces plus the Metropolitan City of Milan). The region ranks first in Italy in terms 
                of population, population density and number of local authorities, while it is fourth in terms of surface area, after Sicily, Piedmont and Sardinia.
                It is the second most populous region of the European Union (EU),[12] and the second region of the European Union by nominal GDP.[2] Lombardy is the first region of Italy in terms of economic importance, contributing to approximately a fifth of the national gross 
                domestic product (GDP). Lombardy is a member of the Four Motors for Europe, an international economical organization whose other members are Baden-Württemberg in Germany, Catalonia in Spain, and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in France. Milan is the economic capital of Italy and is a global financial centre.</p>

            <p>
                In this tale (one of the first versions of <em>Cat in Boots</em>), the cat helps his owner to achieve great riches and fame. In this section of the tale, the cats convinces the king that Gagliuso owns many estates in various parts of the Italian Peninsula, including Lombardy. It is important to
                denote that the concept of Lombardy didn't only refer to the modern day region of Lombardy itself, but also to parts of Piedmont and Emilia.
