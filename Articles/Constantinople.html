            <h1>Constantinople</h1>
            <p>Constantinople (see other names) became the capital of the Roman Empire during the reign of Constantine the Great in 330. Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the late 
                5th century, Constantinople remained the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire; 330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin Empire (1204–1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). 
                Following the Turkish War of Independence, the Turkish capital then moved to Ankara. 
                Officially renamed Istanbul in 1930, the city is today the largest city in Europe, straddling the Bosporus strait and lying in both Europe and Asia, and the financial centre of Turkey.
                In 324, after the Western and Eastern Roman Empires were reunited, the ancient city of Byzantium was selected to serve as the new capital of the Roman Empire, and the city was 
                renamed Nova Roma, or 'New Rome', by Emperor Constantine the Great. On 11 May 330, it was renamed Constantinople and dedicated to Constantine. Constantinople is generally considered to 
                be the center and the "cradle of Orthodox Christian civilization". From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe.[9] The city became 
                famous for its architectural masterpieces, such as Hagia Sophia, the cathedral of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; the sacred Imperial Palace, where the emperors 
                lived; the Hippodrome; the Golden Gate of the Land Walls; and opulent aristocratic palaces. The University of Constantinople was founded in the 5th century and contained artistic and literary treasures before it 
                was sacked in 1204 and 1453,[10] including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had 100,000 volumes. The city was the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of 
                Constantinople and guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross.</p>

                Here, again, the main antagonist (the Great Turk) is presented as a blood thirsty, cruel despot, the main challenge for the protagonist. In turn Constantinople (the main setting for the story), becomes
                the beacon of a sketchy, difficult city, exemplified by the doctors' treatment of the protagonist. Constantinople is a beautiful prison, made of gardens where snakes lurk beneath the shadows of the fruit trees.
