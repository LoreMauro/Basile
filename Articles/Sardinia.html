            <h1>Sardinia</h1>
            <p>
                Sardinia (/sɑːrˈdɪniə/ sar-DIN-ee-ə; Italian: Sardegna [sarˈdeɲɲa]; Sardinian: Sardigna [saɾˈdiɲːa]) is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, and one of the twenty regions of Italy. It is located west of the Italian Peninsula, north of Tunisia and immediately south of the French island of Corsica.
                It is one of the five Italian regions with some degree of domestic autonomy being granted by a special statute.[5] Its official name, Autonomous Region of Sardinia, is bilingual in Italian and Sardinian: Regione Autonoma della Sardegna / Regione Autònoma de Sardigna. It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city. 
                The capital of the region of Sardinia — and its largest city — is Cagliari. Sardinia's indigenous language and Algherese Catalan are referred to by both the regional and national law as two of Italy's twelve officially recognized linguistic minorities, albeit gravely endangered, while the regional law provides some measures to 
                recognize and protect the aforementioned as well as the island's other minority languages (the Corsican-influenced Sassarese and Gallurese, and finally Tabarchino Ligurian).
                Owing to the variety of Sardinia's ecosystems, which include mountains, woods, plains, stretches of largely uninhabited territory, streams, rocky coasts, and long sandy beaches, Sardinia has been metaphorically described as a micro-continent. In the modern era, many travelers and writers have extolled the beauty of its 
                long-untouched landscapes, which retain vestiges of the Nuragic civilization.

            <h2 class="sottotitolo">First Day, Gatta Cenerentola</h2>
            <p>
                In this tale, the first version of Cinderella, the main character's father marries her private tutor, who becomes a vicious step-mother. During the wedding ceremony, a dove tells Cinderella (here called Zezolla) to ask for the help of Sardinia's fairies, in order to go over her troubles. When her father has to depart for the island 
                Zezolla tells him to vouch for her to the fairies, otherwise he won't be able to return. Her father does that, and in exchange the fairies give him some objects to give to her daughter, in order to help her in times of need. It's probable that Sardinia's connection to the fairies comes from real folklore, that can be found in the 
                archaeological objects known as <em>domus de janas</em>.

            <h2 class="sottotitolo">Fifth Day, The Five Sons</h2>
            <p>
                Pacione has five sons whom he sends out into the world to learn a few arts. By the end of the year Pike is first among thieves, Tittillo builds boats, Renzone is formidable with the crossbow, Iacovo recognizes a herb that raises the dead, and Menecuccio understands the language of birds. It is from the birds that the family learns 
                that the king of Altogolfo will give his daughter in marriage to anyone who will save her from the ogre who took her to a cliff. Tittilo builds a boat to go to the king in Sardinia and accept the feat, then they go to the rock where Cianna is imprisoned.
