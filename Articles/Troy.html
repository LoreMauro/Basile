            <h1>Troy</h1>
            <p>Troy (Turkish: Troya, Greek: Τροία, Hittite: 𒋫𒊒𒄿𒊭 Truwiša/Taruiša) or Ilion (Greek: Ίλιον, Hittite: 𒌷𒃾𒇻𒊭 Wiluša) was an ancient city located in present-day Hisarlık, Turkey. The place was first settled around 3600 BC and grew into a small 
                fortified city around 3000 BC. During its four thousand years of existence, Troy was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. As a result, the archeological site that has been left, is divided into nine layers, each corresponding to a city 
                built on the ruins of the previous. Archaeologists refer to these layers using Roman numerals. Among the early layers, Troy II is notable for its wealth and imposing architecture. During the Late Bronze Age, Troy was called Wilusa and was a vassal of the Hittite Empire. 
               The final layers (Troy VIII-IX) were Greek and Roman cities which in their days served as tourist attractions and religious centers because of their link to mythic tradition.
               The archaeological site is open to the public as a tourist destination, and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998. The site was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann and Frank Calvert starting in 1871. Under the ruins of the classical city, they found the remains of 
               numerous earlier settlements. Several of these layers resemble literary depictions of Troy, leading some scholars to conclude that there is a kernel of truth underlying the legends. Subsequent excavations by others have added to the modern understanding of the site, though the exact relationship between myth and reality remains unclear and there is no definitive evidence for a Greek attack on the city.</p>

                Troy is listed among other cities whose ashes are collected by the personification of Time, who collects the ashes of great cities who have turned to dust. The whole passage is full of mystic
                references to symbols like the Phoenix, the Ourobouros and in general the concept of decay and of going over the natural decay everything goes through during the passage of time, the topic of the 
                fable itself.
