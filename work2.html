                        The frame story is that of a cursed, melancholy princess named Zoza ("mud" or "slime" in Neapolitan, but also used as a term of endearment). 
                        <p>
                            The king of Vallepelosa has a daughter, Zoza, who has never laughed in her life, and all her father's attempts are in vain. One day Zoza sees an old woman arguing with a page and lifts her skirt to insult him. The scene makes Zoza burst out laughing, but the old woman feels insulted and curses her: Zoza will never be able to marry anyone other than the prince of Camporotondo. Zoza discovers that Prince Tadeo is dead, and to bring him back to life she will have to fill a jug with tears in three days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zoza sets off for Camporotondo and is hosted by a fairy who gives her a walnut and recommends it to her sister. The second fairy gives her a hazelnut and sends her to the third sister, who gives her a chestnut. Once she arrives in Camporotondo, Zoza begins to cry to fill the jug, but falls asleep when it's very close. The slave Lucia passes by and sheds her missing tears, bringing Tadeo back to life. The prince marries Lucia out of gratitude without knowing anything of what Zoza has done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zoza does not give up and takes a house opposite the royal palace, attracting Tadeo's attention. Meanwhile Lucia becomes pregnant. Zoza opens the walnut and an adorable little dwarf comes out and sings: Lucia sees it and feels an immense desire to have it, and when Tadeo goes to ask Zoza for it, she gives it to him. Some time later Zoza opens the chestnut and a hen comes out with twelve golden chicks, and this time too Lucia wants it, and Zoza gives it to Tadeo. Zoza then opens the hazelnut and a doll comes out spinning gold. Lucia also manages to get the doll, but as soon as she puts it near her it gives her an intense desire for stories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make Lucia happy, Tadeo organizes days of games and stories. Ten women are called for the stories: Zeza, Cecca, Meneca, Tolla, Popa, Antonella, Ciulla, Paola, Ciommetella and Iacova. Each guest tells a story a day. On the fifth day Iacova has an illness and Zoza is called to replace her. Zoza has the last story of the day, and she tells her own story, revealing Lucia's deception. Tadeo understands that he is telling the truth also from his wife's reactions. Lucia is sentenced to death, while Tadeo marries Zoza and sends for her father for the celebrations.

                        <p>
                            This frame story in itself is a fairy tale, combining motifs that will appear in other stories: the princess who cannot laugh in The Magic Swan, Golden Goose, and The Princess Who Never Smiled; the curse to marry only one hard-to-find person, in Snow-White-Fire-Red and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa; and the heroine falling asleep while trying to save the hero, and then losing him because of trickery in The Sleeping Prince and Nourie Hadig.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The now-pregnant slave-princess demands (at the impetus of Zoza's fairy gifts) that her husband tell her stories, or else she would crush the unborn child. The husband hires ten female storytellers to keep her amused; disguised among them is Zoza. Each tells five stories, most of which are more suitable to courtly, rather than juvenile, audiences. The Moorish woman's treachery is revealed in the final story (related, suitably, by Zoza), and she is buried, pregnant, up to her neck in the ground and left to die. Zoza and the Prince live happily ever after.
