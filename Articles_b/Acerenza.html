            <h1>Acerenza (Vallepelosa)</h1>
            <p>
                The town, then known as Aceruntia, Acheruntia or Acherontia, was conquered by the Romans in 318 BC. Later, it was taken by the Ostrogoths (it was mentioned as an important fortress during the Gothic Wars) and then the Lombards, who fortified the town. 
                In 788 Charlemagne ordered that its walls be destroyed. In 1041, after a period in which it was fought over by the Principality of Salerno and the Byzantine Empire, it was conquered again by the Norman Robert Guiscard.
                The town has been the see of an archbishop since at least 499, when a Justus is known. According to legend, the town's first bishop was appointed by St. Peter.
                From the 16th century, Acerenza was held under the feudal lordship of the Marquess of Galatone, that family being granted the title Duke of Acerenza on 12 April 1593 by Philip II of Spain. Through marriage the duchy of Acerenza was 
                inherited by the family of the Prince Belmonte, in whose line the title has descended to the present day.

                The identification of Vallepelosa with the town of Acerenza (where Basile lived for a period as a functionary) is as old as the Pentamerone itself. It's interesting to note that around the area of Acerenza a location, known as <em>Valle della Pila</em>, where
                popular tradition identifies a place called <em>Valle del Trono</em>, maybe the inspiration Basile had to place the kingdom where the story around the stories is set.
